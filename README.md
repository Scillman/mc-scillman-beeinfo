# Description
_BeeInfo is a rewritten and updated version of Giselbaer's [Beenfo mod](https://github.com/gbl/Beenfo)._

The mod shows the honey level, number of baby and adult bees inside hives and nests. Numbers can be displayed through tooltips, HUD and menu depending on the user's settings.

Differences versus the original:
- It does not require third-party mods.
   - Mod Menu is optional but can be used to tweak settings.
- On top of the tooltips both the menu and HUD are included.
   - Like the original, there is currently no further interaction in the menu.
- The HUD displays different icons for adult and baby bees.
- Tooltips differentiate between adult and baby bees.
